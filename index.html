He soon arrived in what's known today and immediatly got to exploiting the natural population and mining all their gold. All this gold made him rich enough to buy himself a new <a href="https://www.target.com/p/dualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5-nova-pink/-/A-85561292?preselect=85561292" >DualSense Wireless Controller for PlayStation 5</a>.
